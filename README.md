# Python_Data_Science
Introduction of Data Science with Python

Hello fellas,

This project aims to help anyone that wants to learn how to program in Python in order to work with Data Science.
The available scripts in this project are notes that I have been making for my learning process.
I tried to bundle some examples that I learned in some courses.
Welcome to this repository and I wish you can learn Python in a pleasant way.

Best regards
Researcher Retorta
