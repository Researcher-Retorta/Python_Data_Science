Introduction of Data Science with Python

Hello fellas,

This project aims to help anyone that wants to learn how to program in Python in order to work with Data Science.
All the available material in this project belong to the Introduction to Data Science in Python course in Coursera platform.
I tried to bundle all the examples the course teach in each week  (composed by 4 weeks).
Welcome to this repository and I wish you can learn Python in a pleasure way.

Best regards
Researcher Retorta
